# Readers plug - Genre Prediction using Natural Language Processing

Readers-plug is a natural language processing (NLP) project that utilizes CountVectorizer and multiple classifiers, including SVC, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest, to predict the genre of a novel based on its summary.

## Demo

For a demonstration of Readers-plug in action, please check out the [demo](https://youtu.be/HBhM5NsOShs).

## About

Readers-plug harnesses the power of NLP to provide users with an intelligent genre prediction system for novels. Key features include:

- **CountVectorizer:** Transforming text data into numerical feature vectors suitable for machine learning algorithms.

- **Multiple Classifiers:** Employing Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Naive Bayes, and Random Forest classifiers to achieve accurate genre predictions.

With Readers-plug, you can effortlessly predict the genre of a novel by simply providing its summary.

## How to Run Locally

To run Readers-plug on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Create a virtual environment and install the required packages using either pip or conda. The necessary packages are:

   - NLTK: A comprehensive toolkit for natural language processing.
   - Flask: A lightweight web application framework for the backend.
   - scikit-learn: A powerful machine learning library.

   ```
   pip install nltk flask scikit-learn
   ```

2. After installing the dependencies, navigate to the project directory and run the following command to start the local server:

   ```
   python app.py
   ```

3. The application will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8080` in your web browser.

## Technologies Used

Readers-plug utilizes the following technologies:

- Python: The primary programming language for the backend development and NLP.
- NLTK: A versatile NLP toolkit for processing and analyzing text data.
- Flask: A minimalist web framework for serving the prediction model.
- scikit-learn: A robust machine learning library for building and evaluating classifiers.
